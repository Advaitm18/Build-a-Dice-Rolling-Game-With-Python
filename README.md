# Build-a-Dice-Rolling-Game-With-Python-Programming

In a Dice Rolling Game programmed in Python, players can engage in a thrilling competition against a bot. The objective of the game is to accumulate the highest number of points after five rounds in order to secure victory. 

## Description
The game incorporates both in-built and user-defined modules to enhance the gaming experience. Each player takes turns rolling the dice, and the resulting points are tallied at the end of each round. The bot's actions are determined by a set of programmed rules, adding an element of challenge and unpredictability to the game. With each round, players strategize and make decisions based on their accumulated points and the bot's performance, making the game exciting and engaging. The player who outmaneuvers the bot and accumulates the most points at the end of five rounds emerges as the winner of the game. 

### Requirement
In order to play a dice rolling game using Python programming, you will need to have **Python** installed on your computer. Python is a widely-used programming language that is known for its simplicity and readability. Additionally, you will need to have **Jupyter Notebook** installed, which is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Once you have both Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, you can begin coding and creating your dice rolling game.

### Implemented Python Concept 
The Python **Random Module** offers various functions for generating random numbers. One of these functions is **Randint Function** , which allows us to generate random integers within a specified range. In the context of a dice rolling game, this function can be particularly useful. By using the randint function, we can simulate the rolling of a dice and obtain a random number between 1 and 6, representing the different sides of the dice. 
To enhance the user experience, we can also create a **User-Defined module** to display the dice-like structure corresponding to the number rolled.  By combining the randint function with a user-defined display function, we can create an engaging and visually appealing dice rolling game in Python.
